# vacuum_field_calculations
This repository contains LaTeX code for analytical calculations and approximations of vacuum magnetic fields. It focuses on the fields produced by picture-frame toroidal field coils  fields generated by Edge-Localized Mode (ELM) mitigation coils in tokamaks. The calculations aim to provide insights into the structure and effects of these fields.
